THE-PULSAR project was started by Alexey Boitsov and Vladimir Sokoushin in 1996
in St. Petersburg, Russia.

For the reason that tough electronic music and dark culture in general are not
very popular in Russia, THE-PULSAR remained in the shadow until the year 2005.
During this time the musicians released two albums: "Universe" (a 1996 demo),
"Revolution" (1999, Manchester files) and an EP "When Your Body Die" (1997).  In
2004 one more participant, Sergey Naan, joined the group.  The project became
popular in 2005, after the Awakening album was released by Advoxya records.
Since that time the group gives lots of concerts, including joint ones with
other musicians.  THE-PULSAR played on the same stage with the following famous
Russian and European groups: Haujobb, Colony 5, Altera Forma, [T.3.R].  Besides,
the group took part in Russian Existence compilation release presentation, to
which they submitted a cover on Existence composition of the cult German group
Project Pitchfork.
